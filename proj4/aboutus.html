		<h2>We make chocolates</h2>
		<img src="images/about.jpg" alt="About Image"/>
		<p>
			Amazing, delicious, mind-bendingly wonderful chocolate. It's pure
	joy in every bite and it comes from passion. But for us, it's about
	more than chocolate. It's about the land, the people, the dedication
	and the interconnected relationships that bind us all.<br /><br />
	
	For us, chocolate isn't just a product, it's  a journey from bean to
	bar. And while its heart is with the beans themselves, and the
	places where they're grown, lovingly reffered to as our "origin",
	what we do with those beans is just as important. Our small batch
	production is truly an art form. Every aspect of our manufacturing
	process is controlled by us. That means we can guarentee that every
	step, every ingredient, everything that goes into each bar is as
	special as the beans themselves.
